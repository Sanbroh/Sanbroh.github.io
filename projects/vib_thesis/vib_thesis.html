            I immediately recall that one talk from MTHE 494 (a writing course that doubled as a speaker series) where the MTHE alum 
            repeated himself multiple times that the thesis project is what he regrets not spending more time on. Today, I 
            think I share the same feeling as well.

            Even since first year, I thought that design projects and report writing were the highlight of each year/semester (maybe 
            a little too exaggerated... reports were meh on second thought). They tend to be the only content that I felt was what I 
            would have considered "Engineering" before I came to university, so I threw in a lot more effort than I should each year. 
            When thesis rolled around the corner, I thought that I was going to do the same and make the most out of it. But, truth to 
            be told, I think I really should have done more despite the success we had with this project.
