            In the final year of my undergrad, I had the privilege to work as one of the leads for QAero. Looking back, the
            team I worked with that year was filled with some of the most driven and diligent people at Queen's, which led
            to some great achievements that in my opinion were really overshadowed by all the stress that came with our projects.
            Just two years before my turn, the team was left with just one member to carry the torch forward, so it was nothing
            short of incredible that we were able to move forward so fast.

            For the 2024 - 2025 season, we had three goals in mind: (1) Set up a new research branch to work on publications,
            (2) Rework our branding and operations to handle an expansion in headcount, and (3) Start AeroSchool, our
            very own PD program to help members secure jobs and learn more about aerospace engineering. By the time we reached the
            end of the year, we managed to achieve these goals and then some, and had the following portfolio built:

            Our main drone competition, AEAC 2025, was quite challenging. The mission required two different processes:
            <ol>
                <li>Survey a zone for IR emitters (fire sources) and map out the coordinates</li>
                <li>Deliver water to the coordinates (where buckets were placed)</li>
            </ol>
            We decided to approach the problem with two drone designs, one fixed-wing for task 1 and another quadcopter for task 2,
            which worked well in theory but in practice needed more refinement. The team still attended the competition just fine, but
            it seemed like there is still one more cycle to go (hopefully!) before we are comfortable with one-year drone development
            cycles of multiple drones at once.

            Outside of the competitions, however, we found success in our work towards our members! At the annual EngSoc design team
            award thing, we won the Internal Award for member development, which really was what we focused on that year. So, it was
            really good to take the prize home - validations already feel good and it fuels you! Anyways, I think that is a good 
            overview on what was done over our leadership, below are some other highlights (for now, as some stuff still are on-going 
            as I am writing this review):

            I still have great memories of my time on this team. Although it felt quite brief (final year went by so fast!),
            I thought that the whole experience was nevertheless memorable. It was a great experience to end my undergrad career
            with, and I loved every second of it... The late nights, the pizza dinners in the bay, and all those times we filled up
            Stirling C (We kind of owned it!)... I think these memories will stick with me for a long time. I want to also give another 
            special thanks to Jake, the other co-captain, for being an all-around amazing leader, especially for someone who just stepped 
            into his first captain position. Absolutely killed it throughout the entire year!
            Finally, If you happen to be a member (past, future, or present), then I just want to quickly say:
